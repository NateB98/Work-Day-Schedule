# Work-Day-Schedule

for this assignment I created an hourly planner that displays the current day and time. you can input text for each hour to plan out your day
and press save to have it stored to the local storage. if the time matches the hour, it should be green. if it is past the hour it should be grayed out.
if it is in the future it should be blue.
